lol. this was my first ever take-home project when I attempted to apply for an internship less than a month or two months after I started programming. The internship required Java, so the project given to me was in Java. Unfortunately, I knew zero Java. Instead of giving up, I said "Challenge Accepted!" and finished the project within a day and a half of all-nighting. This is some relic stuff.
